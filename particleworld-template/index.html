  <p>Description</p>
  <p>The central concept of the code is to mimic the behavior of fireflies. Fireflies are known for their mesmerizing,
    random flashes of light in the night. In my digital interpretation, each mouse click generates new fireflies.
    These fireflies appear as circles with varying sizes and colors, just like real fireflies might differ in
    appearance. They then follow a circular path around a central point, creating an enchanting display. However, to
    prevent an excessive number of fireflies cluttering the screen, it will automatically remove the oldest firefly
    once there are more than 80 of them.</p>
